I originally planned on making a clock that would display the time as orbiting planets. I wanted the hour to be the sun while the minutes and seconds 'orbited' the sun/hour. I didn't like how this idea was going at all, however, and I ended up scrapping the idea. There's still an element of my previous idea here, with the rotation, but that was largely accidental. I wanted to make it where the hours, minutes, and seconds were all rotating, but I kind of liked how it looked, so I kept it the way it is.
